The Meetup app taught me many key factors of using React. here I learned the importance and usage of using the React to crate a modern website that is able to use a form to allow a user to enter data, take the inputed data and send to an server. Firebase was used as a Backend as a server cloud service to store and share data from the server to the website. I was able to get a greate understandign of functional components, using props and state to pass data and update information on screen.Browserrouter was used along with routes and route to keep api data in sync with the browser. This project helped me understand alot of the key components of using react.
